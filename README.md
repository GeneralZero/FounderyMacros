# FounderyPlugins
Plugins for Foundery (DnD) that can be assigned to Macros


### Animate Tiny Weapons

This is a Script to select the number of Weapon attack rolls to roll.
This then rolls that amount of d20s and then adds the static modifier to each of thoese rolls.
Then manaually creates the regular output that you would see on the rolls making sure to propperly color the crit fails and crit suscesses.
The output is shows up as a single output rather than multable outputs so all of the information is in one spot.


###  Bardic Insperation

This is an easy Token to give the Bardic insperation Effect to a user. This makes it easy to add and remove the effect. Just Hover over the Creature and activate the macro.


### Wild Magic

This Rolls a d20 and will send a blind message to the DM. If wild magic has been trigerred this is in red to make sure that the DM notices.
